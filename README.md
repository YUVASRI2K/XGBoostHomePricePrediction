# XGBoostHomePricePrediction
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features using two different machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor. The goal is to explore and compare the performance of these models in accurately predicting house prices.

Predicting house prices is a significant task in the real estate market, aiding buyers, sellers, and investors in making informed decisions. This project employs Linear Regression for its simplicity and interpretability, and Gradient Boosting Regressor for its ability to handle complex relationships in data.

The dataset used in this project is the kc_house_data.csv. It contains various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location, and additional features relevant to house pricing.
